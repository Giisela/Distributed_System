# DistributedSystemsRMI

The operations that were assigned to activities previously carried out in the information sharing regions (for the already implemented concurrent version - Repository : https://github.com/DanMartyns/DistributedSystemsSockets.git), must now be assigned to independent requests performed on the servers, seen as remote objects, through remote method of invocation. One aims for a solution to be written in Java, to be run in Linux under Java RMI, either in a concentrated manner (on a single platform), or in a distributed fashion (up to 9 different platforms) and to terminate (it must contemplate service shutdown).
